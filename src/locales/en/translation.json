  "aboutDesc": "Currently seeking a final year project opportunity to complete my Computer Science Engineering degree. I am a hardworking and dedicated software developer who enjoys crafting and building useful tools, bringing ideas to life. I graduated high school in the Science field in 2020 and joined ESPRIT since then, a private engineering school that employs Project-Based Learning. This active pedagogical approach allows students to generate knowledge through the creation of tangible products. Since joining, I have been involved in numerous group projects that have enhanced my collaboration skills and critical thinking. Through these projects, I have gained practical knowledge and hands-on experience, with 90% of my university studies centered around project development. In addition to my academic work, I have participated in several internships that have further sharpened my development skills, making me well-prepared for real-world work. I am particularly interested in developing Full stack web applications, but I am versatile and can work on other types of projects as well.",
